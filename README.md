# excess-male-mortality
Supplementary data to the publication on excess male mortality

Here is a publicly available subset of all the data we used in our analysis of excess male mortality in Russia.
We do not publish the raw and some additional data here, to obtain it please email requests@meduza.io.

However, you can still reproduce the calculation of excess mortality based on parsed case data (`data/out/parsed_table_full.parquet`).

Please consult `meduza-excess-male-mortality-Russia.ipynb` for the particulars of our method.
